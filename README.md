# ETS-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-R-Hardware-Retail-Turnover-Analysis

### Project Description:

This project focuses on time series forecasting of retail turnover in Victoria's hardware sector using Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models in R. The analysis involves exploring historical data, identifying seasonal trends, and applying ETS models to predict future sales patterns. The project showcases data preprocessing, model selection, and accuracy evaluation through performance metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). R was used extensively for data visualization, model building, and forecasting, providing insights into retail trends and supporting decision-making in the hardware industry.

### Objectives:

- Data Exploration: Analyze historical retail turnover data from Victoria's hardware sector to identify patterns and trends.
  
- Seasonality and Trend Analysis: Examine the presence of seasonal fluctuations and long-term trends in the dataset.
  
- Modeling: Apply Exponential Smoothing (ETS) models to the time series data for accurate forecasting of future retail sales.
  
- Model Selection: Identify the best-fitting ETS model based on performance metrics such as AIC and BIC.
  
- Forecasting: Generate forecasts for future retail turnover in the hardware sector, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.
  
- Evaluation: Assess the accuracy of the forecasting model using key performance metrics such as MAPE and RMSE.
  
- Visualization: Use R for visualizing both historical data and forecasted values to provide an intuitive understanding of the trends.

### Findings:

- Seasonal Patterns: The analysis revealed clear seasonal trends in the retail turnover data, with sales peaking during certain months of the year.

- ETS Model Performance: The ETS models, particularly those accounting for seasonality, provided strong predictive performance, with low MAPE and RMSE values.
  
- Forecast Accuracy: The selected model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy, offering reliable forecasts for future retail turnover in the hardware sector.

- Trend Insights: A consistent upward trend in retail sales was observed, suggesting positive growth in the hardware industry over time.

- Actionable Insights: The forecasts offer valuable insights for businesses in the sector to optimize inventory, plan promotions, and make strategic decisions based on predicted demand.

### Technologies Used:
- R Programming Language: The entire analysis and forecasting were conducted using R, leveraging libraries like forecast, ggplot2, tseries, and dplyr.
- Exponential Smoothing (ETS) Models: For time series analysis and forecasting.
- Data Visualization: The ggplot2 package was used for creating visual representations of the data and forecast results.
- RMarkdown: For documenting the analysis and creating a report.

### How to Access and Run the Assignment:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
   
2. Open the R project file, and make sure to install the required R libraries.
   
3. Run the R Script: The main analysis is contained within the .R script or .Rmd file. To execute the code and generate the forecast, open the file in RStudio or any R environment and run the script.
   
4. View the Results: The script will generate the required visualizations and forecast results, which can be viewed directly in RStudio or exported as a report from RMarkdown.
